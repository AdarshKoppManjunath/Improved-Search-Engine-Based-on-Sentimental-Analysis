The majority of these people become Canadian citizens. After 1947, domestic immigration law and policy went through major changes, most notably with the Immigration Act, 1976, and the current Immigration and Refugee Protection Act from 2002.\nIn Canada there are four categories of immigrants: family-class (closely related persons of Canadian residents living in Canada), economic immigrants (skilled workers and business people), refugees (people who are escaping persecution, torture or cruel and unusual punishment), and the humanitarian and other category (people accepted as immigrants for humanitarian or compassionate reasons). In 2016, Canada admitted 296,346 permanent residents, compared to 271,845 the previous year – the highest admissions levels since 2010.[1] Of those admitted, 53% were economic immigrants and their accompanying immediate families; 26% were family class; 20% were either resettled refugees or protected persons; and 1% were in the humanitarian and other category.[1]\nAccording to data from the 2016 census by Statistics Canada, 21.9% of the Canadian population reported they were or had ever been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada – nearly the 22.3% recorded during the 1921 Census, which was the highest level since the 1867 Confederation of Canada.[2] More than one in five Canadians were born abroad, and 22.3% of the population belonged to visible minorities, of whom 3 in 10 were born in Canada.[2]\nIn 2013–2014, most of the Canadian public, as well as the major political parties, supported either sustaining or increasing the current level of immigration.[3][4] A 2014 sociological study concluded that "Australia and Canada are the most receptive to immigration among western nations".[5] In 2017, an Angus Reid poll indicated a majority of respondents believed that Canada should accept fewer immigrants and refugees.[6]\nCanadian immigration policies are still evolving. In 2008, Citizenship and Immigration Canada made significant changes to streamline the steady flow of immigrants, such as changes reducing professional categories for skilled immigration as well as caps for immigrants in various categories.[7] In 2015, Canada introduced the Express Entry system, providing a streamlined application process for many economic immigrants.[8] Additional changes were made in April and May 2017.[1]\nContents\n1 History\n1.1 First wave\n1.2 Second wave\n1.3 Third wave (1890–1920) and fourth wave (1940s–1960s)\n1.3.1 Chinese\n1.4 Fifth wave (1970s–present)\n1.5 Citizenship\n1.6 Emigration\n2 Immigration rate\n2.1 2017 border crossings\n3 Immigration categories\n3.1 Economic immigrants\n3.2 Family class\n3.3 Refugees\n3.3.1 Claiming asylum in Canada\n3.3.2 Refugees in detention\n3.3.3 Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program\n3.4 Settlement workers\n3.5 Illegal immigration in Canada\n4 Sources of immigration\n4.1 Canadian immigrant population by country of birth (as of 2016)\n4.2 2011 immigration statistics\n5 Disabilities and accommodation\n6 Recent Canadian attitudes towards immigration\n7 Criticisms\n8 See also\n9 References\n10 Further reading\n10.1 History\n10.2 Guides\n11 External links\nHistory[edit]\nMain articles: History of immigration to Canada and History of Canadian nationality law\nA collection of four maps showing the distribution of the Canadian population for 1851 (Newfoundland 1857), 1871 (Newfoundland 1869), 1901 and 1921 by historical region.\nCome to Stay, printed in 1880 in the Canadian Illustrated News, which refers to immigration to the "Dominion".\nAfter the initial period of British and French colonization, four major waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-aboriginal peoples took place over a period of almost two centuries.

The majority of these people become Canadian citizens. After 1947, domestic immigration law and policy went through major changes, most notably with the Immigration Act, 1976, and the current Immigration and Refugee Protection Act from 2002.\nIn Canada there are four categories of immigrants: family-class (closely related persons of Canadian residents living in Canada), economic immigrants (skilled workers and business people), refugees (people who are escaping persecution, torture or cruel and unusual punishment), and the humanitarian and other category (people accepted as immigrants for humanitarian or compassionate reasons). In 2016, Canada admitted 296,346 permanent residents, compared to 271,845 the previous year – the highest admissions levels since 2010.[1] Of those admitted, 53% were economic immigrants and their accompanying immediate families; 26% were family class; 20% were either resettled refugees or protected persons; and 1% were in the humanitarian and other category.[1]\nAccording to data from the 2016 census by Statistics Canada, 21.9% of the Canadian population reported they were or had ever been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada – nearly the 22.3% recorded during the 1921 Census, which was the highest level since the 1867 Confederation of Canada.[2] More than one in five Canadians were born abroad, and 22.3% of the population belonged to visible minorities, of whom 3 in 10 were born in Canada.[2]\nIn 2013–2014, most of the Canadian public, as well as the major political parties, supported either sustaining or increasing the current level of immigration.[3][4] A 2014 sociological study concluded that "Australia and Canada are the most receptive to immigration among western nations".[5] In 2017, an Angus Reid poll indicated a majority of respondents believed that Canada should accept fewer immigrants and refugees.[6]\nCanadian immigration policies are still evolving. In 2008, Citizenship and Immigration Canada made significant changes to streamline the steady flow of immigrants, such as changes reducing professional categories for skilled immigration as well as caps for immigrants in various categories.[7] In 2015, Canada introduced the Express Entry system, providing a streamlined application process for many economic immigrants.[8] Additional changes were made in April and May 2017.[1]\nContents\n1 History\n1.1 First wave\n1.2 Second wave\n1.3 Third wave (1890–1920) and fourth wave (1940s–1960s)\n1.3.1 Chinese\n1.4 Fifth wave (1970s–present)\n1.5 Citizenship\n1.6 Emigration\n2 Immigration rate\n2.1 2017 border crossings\n3 Immigration categories\n3.1 Economic immigrants\n3.2 Family class\n3.3 Refugees\n3.3.1 Claiming asylum in Canada\n3.3.2 Refugees in detention\n3.3.3 Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program\n3.4 Settlement workers\n3.5 Illegal immigration in Canada\n4 Sources of immigration\n4.1 Canadian immigrant population by country of birth (as of 2016)\n4.2 2011 immigration statistics\n5 Disabilities and accommodation\n6 Recent Canadian attitudes towards immigration\n7 Criticisms\n8 See also\n9 References\n10 Further reading\n10.1 History\n10.2 Guides\n11 External links\nHistory[edit]\nMain articles: History of immigration to Canada and History of Canadian nationality law\nA collection of four maps showing the distribution of the Canadian population for 1851 (Newfoundland 1857), 1871 (Newfoundland 1869), 1901 and 1921 by historical region.\nCome to Stay, printed in 1880 in the Canadian Illustrated News, which refers to immigration to the "Dominion".\nAfter the initial period of British and French colonization, four major waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-aboriginal peoples took place over a period of almost two centuries.

The assailant had been jailed for terrorism offenses and released early.Credit...Henry Nicholls/ReutersBy Elian PeltierJan. 21, 2020LONDON — The British government said on Tuesday that it would toughen terrorism sentences and end early release for serious offenders, following through on promises made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in November after a convicted terrorist who had been automatically released carried out an attack that killed two people near London Bridge.The attacker, Usman Khan, 28, who was released in December 2018 after serving eight years of a 16-year sentence for his involvement in a bomb plot, began a knife attack while attending an event on prison rehabilitation at Fishmongers’ Hall, a central London conference venue. Wearing a fake explosive vest, he fled over the nearby bridge, and he was shot and killed by the police shortly afterward.The attack, during the final weeks of a British general election campaign, set off a heated debate over jail sentences for convicted terrorists and their overall reintegration into society.Under the new legislation, which could be introduced in Parliament this spring, terrorism offenders would serve a minimum of 14 years in prison. The number of probation officers specializing in counterterrorism would be doubled, and the counterterrorist police would receive a 10 percent funding increase, the British Home Office, the government department responsible for policing and national security, said in a statement.“The senseless terror attack at Fishmongers’ Hall in November confronted us with some hard truths about how we deal with terrorist offenders,” Home Secretary Priti Patel said.Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said that law enforcement officers could also use lie detectors on terrorism offenders in order to better assess possible threats. The reliability of polygraph testing is often disputed, but Britain already uses it with some sexual offenders — though the use that can be made of the results is limited and they are not admissible in British courts.“We get a lot of people who are superficially very compliant with the regime,” Mr. Buckland told the British broadcaster Sky News, referring to terrorist offenders in prison. “You can get people who are in fact ‘sleepers’ for many years and then suddenly back come the hatreds and the prejudices.”While in jail, Mr. Khan had assured officials in letters that he wanted to follow a deradicalization program and that he no longer embraced radical views. He had been given an indeterminate sentence in 2012 for his involvement in a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the London Stock Exchange, which was later replaced by a 16-year fixed-term sentence.Referring to Mr. Khan and two other defendants in the same case, a judge said in 2012 that “these offenders would remain, even after a lengthy term of imprisonment, of such a significant risk that the public could not be adequately protected by their being managed on license in the community.”David Videcette, a former antiterrorism detective, said on Tuesday that some of the proposed changes were incremental, such as the use of lie detector tests, while others, like more funding for counterterrorism police, seemed more urgent.He said the domestic terrorism landscape had changed, with fewer “large scale attacks, and more lower-tech ones.”“The individuals involved in them are much harder to catch because they don’t always interact with wider networks,” Mr. Videcette added. “So it’s more labor intensive to monitor them and potentially catch them.”Several European countries have been grappling in recent years with their response to the threat posed by radicalized individuals who may carry small-scale attacks on their own, or regroup with larger cells. They have warned that zero-risk situations do not exist, while trying to reassure a wary public with additional funding and tougher security measures whose impact often takes years to assess.In France, officials have reinforced intelligence resources in prison to monitor soon-to-be-released inmates, as a majority of its 500 terrorist convicts and more than 1,200 inmates suspected of radicalization are scheduled to leave prison within the next few years.After the November attack in London, politicians on both ends of the spectrum accused their opponents of having slashed resources dedicated to the monitoring of convicted terrorists.It was ', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/europe/streatham-police-shooting-uk.html': 'U.K. Police Kill Man in a ‘Terrorist Related’ Incident - The New York Times\nSectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexEuropeLog InLog InToday’s PaperEurope|U.K. Police Kill Man in a ‘Terrorist Related’ Incidenthttps://nyti.ms/37QHyljAdvertisementContinue reading the main storySupported byContinue reading the main storyU.K. Police Kill Man in a ‘Terrorist Related’ IncidentThe shooting occurred after people were stabbed in South London.

One of them, a man, was hospitalized with “life-threatening” injuries, according to the police. A third pedestrian, a woman, was believed to have been injured by glass after officers discharged their weapons, the police said.The Metropolitan Police said that officers from “a proactive counterterrorism operation” quickly responded to the “Islamist related” attack and killed Mr. Amman around 2 p.m. local time. The suspect was wearing what appeared to be an explosive device strapped to his body, but it was later found to be false, a police statement said.Mr. Amman was pronounced dead at the scene, said Ms. D’Orsi. Images on social media showed his body lying on the pavement outside a pharmacy while at least two officers pointed guns at him.The stabbings unfolded on Streatham High Road, a crowded thoroughfare filled with shops, cafes and a movie theater. Witnesses told reporters they had seen what appeared to be plainclothes officers chasing and shouting at a man before hearing shots.\n1 mile\nThames\nLondon\nA3\nBRIXTON Rd.\nBRIXTON\nEAST\nDULWICH\nA23\nA205\nENGLAND\nStreatham\nSite of Attack\nLondon\nSTREATHAM\nHIGH Rd.\nDetail\narea\nBy The New York TimesGulled Bulhan, 19, said that he had been crossing the street when he saw a man with a machete “and silver canisters on his chest” being chased by what appeared to be an armed undercover officer, according to the BBC.Karker Tahir, who worked at a shop nearby, said that the officers asked the man to halt before they shot him.“They kept telling him, ‘Stop, stop!’” Mr. Tahir told Sky News. “But he didn’t stop, and then I saw that they shot him three times,” he said. He added that the police told him and a colleague that “you have to leave the shop because he has a bomb in his bag.’”“I’m still shocked,” he said.A video circulating on Twitter showed what appeared to be at least two plainclothes officers drawing their weapons as they took cover behind a police car. A flurry of yellow ambulances and police cars with loud sirens and blinking lights also flooded the street.The speed with which the police declared a terrorism-related attack on Sunday stood in stark contrast to their announcements after previous attacks, when the authorities took hours or days to say that a terrorist assault had taken place.David Videcette, a former British counterterrorism detective, said on Sunday that though the investigation was still in its early stages, he believed that the police officers who quickly responded to the stabbing had been part of a focused surveillance operation.The Metropolitan Police’s counterterrorism unit was leading the investigation into the attack, according to Ms. D’Orsi.Mr. Amman had been arrested in May 2018 under the Terrorism Act. He was brought to the attention of the police by a blogger from Holland, who posted one of his Telegram messages online. The message was a photo that showed two guns and a knife “on top of an Islamic flag, with the caption “Armed and ready April 3” overlaid in Arabic,” the police said.He was sentenced in December 2018 to three years and four months in prison for six counts of collecting information “likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism” and seven counts of “dissemination of terrorist material,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement at the time.According to the BBC, Mr. Amman was released about one week ago, after serving part of his sentence.

UK medics should not be held back\nRichard Vize\nDeciding when it is safe to treat wounded people is a perilously hard judgment call that needs urgent reassessment\nFri 7 Feb 2020 08.13\xa0GMT\nLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2020 08.30\xa0GMT\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare via Email\nIn the aftermath of the Streatham attack, a passer-by who tended to an injured man claimed ambulance crews took 30 minutes to arrive.\nPhotograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images\nThe Streatham terrorist attack has again highlighted one of the most difficult decisions the emergency services face – deciding when it is safe to treat wounded people.\nIn the aftermath of the stabbings by Sudesh Amman, a passer-by who helped a man lying on the pavement bleeding claimed ambulance crews took 30 minutes to arrive. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) said the first medics arrived in four minutes, but waited at the assigned rendezvous point until the Metropolitan police confirmed it was safe to move in.\nLike the perpetrators of the London Bridge attacks in both 2017 and 2019, Amman was wearing a hoax suicide vest.\nThere is a long, brutal history, from Baghdad to the Warrenpoint ambush in 1979 , of using secondary attacks to slay those who rush to terror scenes. The inevitable chaos of a bomb or an attack by several people, such as the 2017 attacks in London Bridge and Borough market, means it can take a long time to be sure all the perpetrators are accounted for.\nLondon Bridge attack: response reminded me of my pride in our extraordinary NHS | Vinod Diwakar\nRead more\nBut last summer, the London Bridge inquest heard it took three hours for paramedics to reach some of the wounded. Prompt treatment might have saved the life of French chef Sebastian Belanger, who received CPR from members of the public and police officers for half an hour. A LAS debriefing revealed paramedics’ frustration at not being deployed sooner.\nIn the wake of the two-hour delay in fire crews arriving at the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, called for the inflexible rules around the deployment of emergency services at terrorist incidents to be loosened so staff on the scene could take pragmatic decisions. In the run-up to the London Olympics, the then prime minister, David Cameron, sharply criticised the preparations for an attack for being too risk-averse.\nA group of UK and international experts in delivering medical care during terrorist attacks highlighted alternative approaches in the British Medical Journal last week. In Paris in 2015, the integration of doctors with specialist police teams enabled about 100 wounded people in the Bataclan concert hall to be triaged and evacuated 30 minutes before the terrorists were killed. The experts writing in the BMJ believe the UK approach would have delayed any medical care reaching these victims for three hours.\nThese are perilously hard judgment calls. Policymakers and commanders on the scene have to balance the likelihood that long delays in intervening will lead to more victims dying from their injuries against the increased risk to the lives of medical staff who are potentially putting themselves in the line of fire by entering the so-called “hot zone”.\nThe stilted prose of the inquests and inquiries that follow each attack can never capture the pandemonium, panic and fear in the midst of whic", 'https://news.sky.com/story/terror-in-the-uk-timeline-of-attacks-11833061': 'Terror in the UK: Timeline of attacks | UK News | Sky News\nSkip to content\nWatch Live\nMenu\nHome\nUK\nWorld\nPolitics\nUS\nClimate\nScience & Tech\nBusiness\nEnts & Arts\nTravel\nOffbeat\nAnalysis\nOpinion\nSky Views\nVideos\nWeather\nMore\nHome\nUK\nWorld\nPolitics\nUS\nClimate\nScience & Tech\nBusiness\nEnts & Arts\nTravel\nOffbeat\nAnalysis\nOpinion\nSky Views\nVideos\nWeather\nWatch Live\nTerror in the UK: Timeline of attacks\nFill 2 Copy 11\nCreated with Sketch.\nSunday 2 February 2020 18:36, UK\nimage/svg+xml\nWhy you can trust Sky News\nA man has been shot dead by police and three people stabbed in Streatham, south London, in what Scotland Yard have described as a terror attack.\nImage:\nStreatham terror attack\nThe current terror threat in the UK is substantial - the third-highest level - meaning "an attack is likely".Sky News looks at recent terror plots carried out in Britain.\n29 November 2019\nThree dead at London Bridge\nImage:\nKiller Usman Khan was subdued by members of the public before being shot dead by police\nConvicted terrorist Usman Khan embarked on a deadly rampage armed with two knives and wearing a fake suicide vest after attending a prisoner rehabilitation programme while out on licence halfway through a 16-year jail sentence.Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were both killed and Khan, who was subdued by members of the public using a narwhal tusk and fire extinguisher, was shot dead by police.\n11 October 2019\nThree stabbed at shopping centre in Manchester\nImage:\nFlowers on Westminster Bridge after the terror attack in March 2017\nPolice arrested a man on suspicion of terror offences after three people were stabbed at the Arndale shopping centre.The suspect, in his 40s, was carrying a "large knife" when witnesses said he started lunging and attacking people.The suspect was arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of an act of terrorism.\nImage:\nAn armed police officer outside the Arndale in Manchester\n14 August 2018\nCar smashes into barriers outside parliament\nThree people were injured when a car crashed into security barriers outside parliament.Salih Khater was later convicted of two charges of attempted murder after he ploughed his Ford Fiesta into a pedestrian and a group of cyclists who had stopped at a red light.He then smashed into a security barrier as two uniformed police officers dived out of the way.\nImage:\nThe attacker drove his Fiesta into a pedestrian and a group of cyclists\n15 September 2017\nExplosive detonated on Tube train\nAn improvised explosive device was detonated on a packed Tube train during the morning rush hour, injuring 22 people.Passengers reported seeing a "fireball" and a "wall of flame", with those hurt "covered in blood".Ahmed Hassan, 18, was jailed for life for the attack.\nImage:\nEighteen-year-old Ahmed Hassan was jailed for life.

In the late 20th century there were also isolated attacks by Middle Eastern terrorist groups, though it was still the fact that the vast majority of the attacks were the work of the IRA and allied groups.\nDuring the 21st century, however, most terrorist incidents in Britain have been linked to Islamic fundamentalism.[2] An interpretation of this change is that terrorist incidents in Britain may be growing due to Britain\'s participation in the Iraq War and its role in the Syrian Civil War,[3][4][5] including shelling the country as part of a coalition with other Western countries.[6] Polling shows most Britons agree with the theory that their country\'s actions in Muslim lands provoke blowback in the form of terror attacks.[7]\nSince 1970, there have been at least 3,395 terrorist-related deaths in the UK, the highest in western Europe.[8] The vast majority of the deaths were linked to the Northern Ireland conflict and happened in Northern Ireland.[8] Between 1971 and 2001, there were 430 terrorist-related deaths in Great Britain. Of these, 125 deaths were linked to the Northern Ireland conflict,[9] and 305 deaths were linked to other causes[10] – most of the latter deaths occurred in the Lockerbie bombing.[10] Since 2001, there have been almost 100 terrorist-related deaths in Great Britain, the vast majority linked to Islamic jihad and religious extremism.[needs update]\nContents\n1 Great Britain\n1.1 19th century\n1.2 1939–1940\n1.3 1970s\n1.4 1980s\n1.5 1990s\n1.6 2000s\n1.7 2010s\n1.8 2020s\n2 Prevented, failed or aborted attacks\n3 Arrests, detentions, and other incidents related to the Terrorism Acts\n4 See also\n5 References\nGreat Britain[edit]\nThis list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.\n19th century[edit]\n1867, 13 December: Clerkenwell explosion: members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), nicknamed the "Fenians", detonated a bomb against the outer wall of Clerkenwell Prison, in an attempt to free one of their comrades.

It was known as the S-Plan or Sabotage Campaign. During the campaign, the IRA carried out almost 300 attacks and acts of sabotage in Britain, killing seven people and injuring 96.[14] Most of the casualties occurred in the Coventry bombing on 25 August 1939.\n1970s[edit]\n1971, 12 January: Two bombs exploded at the house of government minister Robert Carr.

Over several months, four undercover officers befriended him and the former Uber driver turned chicken shop driver shared with them his plans to use guns, knives or a vehicle to cause murder and mayhem, leading to his arrest three days before Pride, which he had discussed attacking with a vehicle.\nHe also bragged to them about deceiving the jury in 2018, seeming particularly proud of the ruse of shaving off his beard before going to court. He said that his intention had been to “whack” a soldier at the palace.\nVideo from police interviews after his arrest showed that he initially cut a nonchalant figure, telling officers that it was all a misunderstanding fuelled by misguided suspicion over his innocent interest in weightlifting and martial arts.\nCommander Richard Smith, head of the Met ’s counter-terrorism command, said officers attributed Chowdhury’s relaxed demeanour at that time to the fact “he believed one of the covert officers, ‘Mikael’, was planning on carrying out an attack and we believe he may have been trying to buy time for Mikael to do so”.\nHowever, on the day of Pride, police played him recordings of some of his conversations with undercover officers and Chowdhury’s mood changed. His head bowed, his shoulders drooped and he refused to answer further questions.\nDuring the time he was under surveillance, Chowdhury bought a BB gun, which was a replica Glock, and tried to acquire a real firearm. He also shared a graphic execution video with undercover officers via WhatsApp.\nHis conversations with officers were recorded and played in court, as were those with his sister Sneha Chowdhury, 25, at the home they shared, in Luton, which had been bugged.\nShe had given evidence against him in his Buckingham Palace trial but after his release he told her: “I’m doing another a", 'https://www.gov.uk/compensation-victim-terrorist-attack': "Compensation for victims of terrorist attacks abroad - GOV.UK\nSkip to main content\nTell us whether you accept cookies\nWe use cookies to collect information about how you use GOV.UK.

The assailant had been jailed for terrorism offenses and released early.Credit...Henry Nicholls/ReutersBy Elian PeltierJan. 21, 2020LONDON — The British government said on Tuesday that it would toughen terrorism sentences and end early release for serious offenders, following through on promises made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in November after a convicted terrorist who had been automatically released carried out an attack that killed two people near London Bridge.The attacker, Usman Khan, 28, who was released in December 2018 after serving eight years of a 16-year sentence for his involvement in a bomb plot, began a knife attack while attending an event on prison rehabilitation at Fishmongers’ Hall, a central London conference venue. Wearing a fake explosive vest, he fled over the nearby bridge, and he was shot and killed by the police shortly afterward.The attack, during the final weeks of a British general election campaign, set off a heated debate over jail sentences for convicted terrorists and their overall reintegration into society.Under the new legislation, which could be introduced in Parliament this spring, terrorism offenders would serve a minimum of 14 years in prison. The number of probation officers specializing in counterterrorism would be doubled, and the counterterrorist police would receive a 10 percent funding increase, the British Home Office, the government department responsible for policing and national security, said in a statement.“The senseless terror attack at Fishmongers’ Hall in November confronted us with some hard truths about how we deal with terrorist offenders,” Home Secretary Priti Patel said.Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said that law enforcement officers could also use lie detectors on terrorism offenders in order to better assess possible threats. The reliability of polygraph testing is often disputed, but Britain already uses it with some sexual offenders — though the use that can be made of the results is limited and they are not admissible in British courts.“We get a lot of people who are superficially very compliant with the regime,” Mr. Buckland told the British broadcaster Sky News, referring to terrorist offenders in prison. “You can get people who are in fact ‘sleepers’ for many years and then suddenly back come the hatreds and the prejudices.”While in jail, Mr. Khan had assured officials in letters that he wanted to follow a deradicalization program and that he no longer embraced radical views. He had been given an indeterminate sentence in 2012 for his involvement in a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the London Stock Exchange, which was later replaced by a 16-year fixed-term sentence.Referring to Mr. Khan and two other defendants in the same case, a judge said in 2012 that “these offenders would remain, even after a lengthy term of imprisonment, of such a significant risk that the public could not be adequately protected by their being managed on license in the community.”David Videcette, a former antiterrorism detective, said on Tuesday that some of the proposed changes were incremental, such as the use of lie detector tests, while others, like more funding for counterterrorism police, seemed more urgent.He said the domestic terrorism landscape had changed, with fewer “large scale attacks, and more lower-tech ones.”“The individuals involved in them are much harder to catch because they don’t always interact with wider networks,” Mr. Videcette added. “So it’s more labor intensive to monitor them and potentially catch them.”Several European countries have been grappling in recent years with their response to the threat posed by radicalized individuals who may carry small-scale attacks on their own, or regroup with larger cells. They have warned that zero-risk situations do not exist, while trying to reassure a wary public with additional funding and tougher security measures whose impact often takes years to assess.In France, officials have reinforced intelligence resources in prison to monitor soon-to-be-released inmates, as a majority of its 500 terrorist convicts and more than 1,200 inmates suspected of radicalization are scheduled to leave prison within the next few years.After the November attack in London, politicians on both ends of the spectrum accused their opponents of having slashed resources dedicated to the monitoring of convicted terrorists.It was ', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/europe/streatham-police-shooting-uk.html': 'U.K. Police Kill Man in a ‘Terrorist Related’ Incident - The New York Times\nSectionsSEARCHSkip to contentSkip to site indexEuropeLog InLog InToday’s PaperEurope|U.K. Police Kill Man in a ‘Terrorist Related’ Incidenthttps://nyti.ms/37QHyljAdvertisementContinue reading the main storySupported byContinue reading the main storyU.K. Police Kill Man in a ‘Terrorist Related’ IncidentThe shooting occurred after people were stabbed in South London.

One of them, a man, was hospitalized with “life-threatening” injuries, according to the police. A third pedestrian, a woman, was believed to have been injured by glass after officers discharged their weapons, the police said.The Metropolitan Police said that officers from “a proactive counterterrorism operation” quickly responded to the “Islamist related” attack and killed Mr. Amman around 2 p.m. local time. The suspect was wearing what appeared to be an explosive device strapped to his body, but it was later found to be false, a police statement said.Mr. Amman was pronounced dead at the scene, said Ms. D’Orsi. Images on social media showed his body lying on the pavement outside a pharmacy while at least two officers pointed guns at him.The stabbings unfolded on Streatham High Road, a crowded thoroughfare filled with shops, cafes and a movie theater. Witnesses told reporters they had seen what appeared to be plainclothes officers chasing and shouting at a man before hearing shots.\n1 mile\nThames\nLondon\nA3\nBRIXTON Rd.\nBRIXTON\nEAST\nDULWICH\nA23\nA205\nENGLAND\nStreatham\nSite of Attack\nLondon\nSTREATHAM\nHIGH Rd.\nDetail\narea\nBy The New York TimesGulled Bulhan, 19, said that he had been crossing the street when he saw a man with a machete “and silver canisters on his chest” being chased by what appeared to be an armed undercover officer, according to the BBC.Karker Tahir, who worked at a shop nearby, said that the officers asked the man to halt before they shot him.“They kept telling him, ‘Stop, stop!’” Mr. Tahir told Sky News. “But he didn’t stop, and then I saw that they shot him three times,” he said. He added that the police told him and a colleague that “you have to leave the shop because he has a bomb in his bag.’”“I’m still shocked,” he said.A video circulating on Twitter showed what appeared to be at least two plainclothes officers drawing their weapons as they took cover behind a police car. A flurry of yellow ambulances and police cars with loud sirens and blinking lights also flooded the street.The speed with which the police declared a terrorism-related attack on Sunday stood in stark contrast to their announcements after previous attacks, when the authorities took hours or days to say that a terrorist assault had taken place.David Videcette, a former British counterterrorism detective, said on Sunday that though the investigation was still in its early stages, he believed that the police officers who quickly responded to the stabbing had been part of a focused surveillance operation.The Metropolitan Police’s counterterrorism unit was leading the investigation into the attack, according to Ms. D’Orsi.Mr. Amman had been arrested in May 2018 under the Terrorism Act. He was brought to the attention of the police by a blogger from Holland, who posted one of his Telegram messages online. The message was a photo that showed two guns and a knife “on top of an Islamic flag, with the caption “Armed and ready April 3” overlaid in Arabic,” the police said.He was sentenced in December 2018 to three years and four months in prison for six counts of collecting information “likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism” and seven counts of “dissemination of terrorist material,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement at the time.According to the BBC, Mr. Amman was released about one week ago, after serving part of his sentence.

UK medics should not be held back\nRichard Vize\nDeciding when it is safe to treat wounded people is a perilously hard judgment call that needs urgent reassessment\nFri 7 Feb 2020 08.13\xa0GMT\nLast modified on Fri 7 Feb 2020 08.30\xa0GMT\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare via Email\nIn the aftermath of the Streatham attack, a passer-by who tended to an injured man claimed ambulance crews took 30 minutes to arrive.\nPhotograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images\nThe Streatham terrorist attack has again highlighted one of the most difficult decisions the emergency services face – deciding when it is safe to treat wounded people.\nIn the aftermath of the stabbings by Sudesh Amman, a passer-by who helped a man lying on the pavement bleeding claimed ambulance crews took 30 minutes to arrive. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) said the first medics arrived in four minutes, but waited at the assigned rendezvous point until the Metropolitan police confirmed it was safe to move in.\nLike the perpetrators of the London Bridge attacks in both 2017 and 2019, Amman was wearing a hoax suicide vest.\nThere is a long, brutal history, from Baghdad to the Warrenpoint ambush in 1979 , of using secondary attacks to slay those who rush to terror scenes. The inevitable chaos of a bomb or an attack by several people, such as the 2017 attacks in London Bridge and Borough market, means it can take a long time to be sure all the perpetrators are accounted for.\nLondon Bridge attack: response reminded me of my pride in our extraordinary NHS | Vinod Diwakar\nRead more\nBut last summer, the London Bridge inquest heard it took three hours for paramedics to reach some of the wounded. Prompt treatment might have saved the life of French chef Sebastian Belanger, who received CPR from members of the public and police officers for half an hour. A LAS debriefing revealed paramedics’ frustration at not being deployed sooner.\nIn the wake of the two-hour delay in fire crews arriving at the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, called for the inflexible rules around the deployment of emergency services at terrorist incidents to be loosened so staff on the scene could take pragmatic decisions. In the run-up to the London Olympics, the then prime minister, David Cameron, sharply criticised the preparations for an attack for being too risk-averse.\nA group of UK and international experts in delivering medical care during terrorist attacks highlighted alternative approaches in the British Medical Journal last week. In Paris in 2015, the integration of doctors with specialist police teams enabled about 100 wounded people in the Bataclan concert hall to be triaged and evacuated 30 minutes before the terrorists were killed. The experts writing in the BMJ believe the UK approach would have delayed any medical care reaching these victims for three hours.\nThese are perilously hard judgment calls. Policymakers and commanders on the scene have to balance the likelihood that long delays in intervening will lead to more victims dying from their injuries against the increased risk to the lives of medical staff who are potentially putting themselves in the line of fire by entering the so-called “hot zone”.\nThe stilted prose of the inquests and inquiries that follow each attack can never capture the pandemonium, panic and fear in the midst of whic", 'https://news.sky.com/story/terror-in-the-uk-timeline-of-attacks-11833061': 'Terror in the UK: Timeline of attacks | UK News | Sky News\nSkip to content\nWatch Live\nMenu\nHome\nUK\nWorld\nPolitics\nUS\nClimate\nScience & Tech\nBusiness\nEnts & Arts\nTravel\nOffbeat\nAnalysis\nOpinion\nSky Views\nVideos\nWeather\nMore\nHome\nUK\nWorld\nPolitics\nUS\nClimate\nScience & Tech\nBusiness\nEnts & Arts\nTravel\nOffbeat\nAnalysis\nOpinion\nSky Views\nVideos\nWeather\nWatch Live\nTerror in the UK: Timeline of attacks\nFill 2 Copy 11\nCreated with Sketch.\nSunday 2 February 2020 18:36, UK\nimage/svg+xml\nWhy you can trust Sky News\nA man has been shot dead by police and three people stabbed in Streatham, south London, in what Scotland Yard have described as a terror attack.\nImage:\nStreatham terror attack\nThe current terror threat in the UK is substantial - the third-highest level - meaning "an attack is likely".Sky News looks at recent terror plots carried out in Britain.\n29 November 2019\nThree dead at London Bridge\nImage:\nKiller Usman Khan was subdued by members of the public before being shot dead by police\nConvicted terrorist Usman Khan embarked on a deadly rampage armed with two knives and wearing a fake suicide vest after attending a prisoner rehabilitation programme while out on licence halfway through a 16-year jail sentence.Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were both killed and Khan, who was subdued by members of the public using a narwhal tusk and fire extinguisher, was shot dead by police.\n11 October 2019\nThree stabbed at shopping centre in Manchester\nImage:\nFlowers on Westminster Bridge after the terror attack in March 2017\nPolice arrested a man on suspicion of terror offences after three people were stabbed at the Arndale shopping centre.The suspect, in his 40s, was carrying a "large knife" when witnesses said he started lunging and attacking people.The suspect was arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of an act of terrorism.\nImage:\nAn armed police officer outside the Arndale in Manchester\n14 August 2018\nCar smashes into barriers outside parliament\nThree people were injured when a car crashed into security barriers outside parliament.Salih Khater was later convicted of two charges of attempted murder after he ploughed his Ford Fiesta into a pedestrian and a group of cyclists who had stopped at a red light.He then smashed into a security barrier as two uniformed police officers dived out of the way.\nImage:\nThe attacker drove his Fiesta into a pedestrian and a group of cyclists\n15 September 2017\nExplosive detonated on Tube train\nAn improvised explosive device was detonated on a packed Tube train during the morning rush hour, injuring 22 people.Passengers reported seeing a "fireball" and a "wall of flame", with those hurt "covered in blood".Ahmed Hassan, 18, was jailed for life for the attack.\nImage:\nEighteen-year-old Ahmed Hassan was jailed for life.

(November 2007) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nThere have been many motives behind terrorism in Great Britain.[1] During the 20th century, most attacks were carried out by various Irish Republican Army (IRA) groups and were linked to the Northern Ireland conflict (the Troubles). In the late 20th century there were also isolated attacks by Middle Eastern terrorist groups, though it was still the fact that the vast majority of the attacks were the work of the IRA and allied groups.\nDuring the 21st century, however, most terrorist incidents in Britain have been linked to Islamic fundamentalism.[2] An interpretation of this change is that terrorist incidents in Britain may be growing due to Britain\'s participation in the Iraq War and its role in the Syrian Civil War,[3][4][5] including shelling the country as part of a coalition with other Western countries.[6] Polling shows most Britons agree with the theory that their country\'s actions in Muslim lands provoke blowback in the form of terror attacks.[7]\nSince 1970, there have been at least 3,395 terrorist-related deaths in the UK, the highest in western Europe.[8] The vast majority of the deaths were linked to the Northern Ireland conflict and happened in Northern Ireland.[8] Between 1971 and 2001, there were 430 terrorist-related deaths in Great Britain. Of these, 125 deaths were linked to the Northern Ireland conflict,[9] and 305 deaths were linked to other causes[10] – most of the latter deaths occurred in the Lockerbie bombing.[10] Since 2001, there have been almost 100 terrorist-related deaths in Great Britain, the vast majority linked to Islamic jihad and religious extremism.[needs update]\nContents\n1 Great Britain\n1.1 19th century\n1.2 1939–1940\n1.3 1970s\n1.4 1980s\n1.5 1990s\n1.6 2000s\n1.7 2010s\n1.8 2020s\n2 Prevented, failed or aborted attacks\n3 Arrests, detentions, and other incidents related to the Terrorism Acts\n4 See also\n5 References\nGreat Britain[edit]\nThis list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.\n19th century[edit]\n1867, 13 December: Clerkenwell explosion: members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), nicknamed the "Fenians", detonated a bomb against the outer wall of Clerkenwell Prison, in an attempt to free one of their comrades.

One person, Harry Pitts, was killed and sixty were injured, ten seriously.[12][13]\n1939–1940[edit]\nFrom January 1939 to March 1940, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) carried out a campaign of bombing and sabotage against the civil, economic, and military infrastructure of Britain. It was known as the S-Plan or Sabotage Campaign. During the campaign, the IRA carried out almost 300 attacks and acts of sabotage in Britain, killing seven people and injuring 96.[14] Most of the casualties occurred in the Coventry bombing on 25 August 1939.\n1970s[edit]\n1971, 12 January: Two bombs exploded at the house of government minister Robert Carr. This attack was one of 25 carried out by the Angry Brigade between August 1970 and August 1971. The Bomb Squad was established at Scotland Yard in January 1971 to target the group, and they were apprehended in August of that year.[15][16]\n1971, 31 October:\nA bomb exploded in the Post Office Tower in London causing extensive damage but no injuries. The "Kilburn Battalion" of the IRA claimed responsibility for the explosion but The Angry Brigade also claimed to have carried out the attack.

Over several months, four undercover officers befriended him and the former Uber driver turned chicken shop driver shared with them his plans to use guns, knives or a vehicle to cause murder and mayhem, leading to his arrest three days before Pride, which he had discussed attacking with a vehicle.\nHe also bragged to them about deceiving the jury in 2018, seeming particularly proud of the ruse of shaving off his beard before going to court. He said that his intention had been to “whack” a soldier at the palace.\nVideo from police interviews after his arrest showed that he initially cut a nonchalant figure, telling officers that it was all a misunderstanding fuelled by misguided suspicion over his innocent interest in weightlifting and martial arts.\nCommander Richard Smith, head of the Met ’s counter-terrorism command, said officers attributed Chowdhury’s relaxed demeanour at that time to the fact “he believed one of the covert officers, ‘Mikael’, was planning on carrying out an attack and we believe he may have been trying to buy time for Mikael to do so”.\nHowever, on the day of Pride, police played him recordings of some of his conversations with undercover officers and Chowdhury’s mood changed. His head bowed, his shoulders drooped and he refused to answer further questions.\nDuring the time he was under surveillance, Chowdhury bought a BB gun, which was a replica Glock, and tried to acquire a real firearm. He also shared a graphic execution video with undercover officers via WhatsApp.\nHis conversations with officers were recorded and played in court, as were those with his sister Sneha Chowdhury, 25, at the home they shared, in Luton, which had been bugged.\nShe had given evidence against him in his Buckingham Palace trial but after his release he told her: “I’m doing another a", 'https://www.gov.uk/compensation-victim-terrorist-attack': "Compensation for victims of terrorist attacks abroad - GOV.UK\nSkip to main content\nTell us whether you accept cookies\nWe use cookies to collect information about how you use GOV.UK.
